**Input Processing:** User voice input is continuously monitored through voice activity detection. When speech is detected, audio data is buffered and processed through the speech recognition pipeline.

**Context Management:** The system maintains conversation context and history, enabling coherent multi-turn dialogues and personalized responses based on previous interactions.

**Response Generation:** Transcribed text is processed by the language model, which generates contextually appropriate responses while considering conversation history and user preferences.

**Output Synthesis:** Generated text responses are converted to natural speech and played back to the user while simultaneously being displayed in the interface for accessibility.

**Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors all components for performance and errors, providing real-time status updates and automatically adjusting behavior based on system conditions.

### System Integration Patterns

#### Microservices-Inspired Design

While not a distributed system, Sophia AI Assistant employs microservices-inspired design patterns that provide many of the benefits of microservices architectures:

**Service Isolation:** Each major component (STT, LLM, TTS, GUI) operates as an independent service with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities.

**Communication Patterns:** Components communicate through standardized message passing and event-driven patterns, reducing coupling and improving testability.

**Resource Management:** Each service manages its own resources and can be optimized independently for performance and memory usage.
